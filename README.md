## EriksMod - Overview
---
EriksMod is my first look at adding modifications to a game, in this case Minecraft. The idea for this project was to learn how modding works and begin to experiment with Java syntax / file structures.

## Development Environment
---
This mod was created in IntelliJ IDE using Forge 1.19.3. Written in Java

## Future Improvements
---
- I plan to add the ability to brew and drink the potion. 
- The plan is to make the potion skip time forward by half a day because there is currently no way to fast forward to night time. This could be very useful while not breaking the game.
- I would like to add another new item needed to brew the potion that is only obtained by killing a new mob. These ideas aren't complete, but that's the path I see this going down.
- Adding potion variants like splash potions, extended potions, potent potions, etc.. so it matches the functions of the vanilla game potions.
